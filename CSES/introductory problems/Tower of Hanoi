//it's a recursive function: how to make a good recursive function?
// the process is similar to that of induction first it has to workfor n=1; then assume it works for n-1 , at the end we must be able to calculate f(n) using n-1

// here by doing some tower of hanoi we can figure that te pile has to go into the opposite pile which can be calculated as 6-(start+end)


void solve(int n, int start, int end){
	if(n==1){
		cout << start << " "<< end<<endl;
	}
	else{
		int other = 6-(start+end);
		solve(n-1,start,other);
		cout << start << " "<< end << endl;
		solve(n-1,other ,end);

	}
